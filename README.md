Rectangle is an open-source Python package for single-cell-informed cell-type deconvolution of bulk and spatial transcriptomic data.

Rectangle presents a novel approach to second-generation deconvolution, characterized by hierarchical processing,
an estimation of unknown cellular content and a significant reduction in data volume during signature matrix computation.

Rectangle was developed to outperform existing deconvolution solutions by introducing methods that promise
improvements in cell-type fraction estimation accuracy while keeping a low computational profile.
